**Introduction**

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning that utilises artificial neural networks has garnered significant attention in drug development due to its ability to automatically extract information from data and display complex, non-linear relationships. This is in addition to conventional machine-learning methods that use molecular descriptors generated by humans. The rebirth of deep learning in drug discovery has accelerated the development of novel approaches and applications that will benefit several domains in cheminformatics.

**Cutting-edge Uses of Artificial Intelligence**

**1.**  **QSAR/QSPR and Structure-Based Modeling**

•        Automatic Feature Extraction, removing the need for manual feature engineering. This enables them to capture complex, nonlinear relationships that conventional quantitative structure-activity relationships/quantitative structure-property relationships (QSAR/QSPR) methods might overlook.

•        Graph Neural Networks, allowing them to learn complex interactions between atoms and bonds. Valuable for predicting biological activity and other properties derived from molecular structures.

•        Multitask Learning, allowing a single model to predict multiple related outcomes simultaneously. This maximises data efficiency and can enhance predictive accuracy across different tasks.

# 2.  De Novo Chemical Design

•        Generative Models like variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) can create new molecular structures by learning from the distribution of existing compounds. This enables the design of novel candidates that fulfil specific requirements.

•        Rule-free design of bioactive molecules that enables the exploration of wider chemical space by not being restricted to predefined synthetic rules, fostering the discovery of novel compounds.

•        Optimisation of multiple Properties simultaneously such as potency and selectivity, through multitask learning.

# 3.  Synthesis Prediction

•        Automated Synthesis Planning which predicts feasible synthetic pathways for new compounds, and is essential for confirming that designed molecules can be practically synthesised.

•        Data-driven insights which allow for the identification of patterns in chemical reactions and synthesis pathways, leading to more informed predictions about the feasibility of synthesising new compound
